# InvoiceGenerator
InvoiceGenerator is a tool used for big generation of invoices based on an .xls file containing invoice data in each row and saving them in one docx file for easy print.

The main library used in this project is **python-docx**. Unfortunately, I encountered some issues when using it with Python 3.9, but it works fine with **Python 3.8**.

Here is a list of libraries I have used:
 - *et-xmlfile	1.1.0	1.1.0*
- *lxml	4.9.2	4.9.2*
- *numpy	1.24.4	1.25.0*
- *openpyxl	3.1.2	3.1.2*
- *pandas	2.0.3	2.0.3*
- *pip	23.1.2	23.1.2*
- *python-dateutil	2.8.2	2.8.2*
- *python-docx	0.8.11	0.8.11*
- *python-docx-2023	0.2.17	0.2.17*
- *pytz	2023.3	2023.3*
- *setuptools	68.0.0	68.0.0*
- *six	1.16.0	1.16.0*
- *tzdata	2023.3	2023.3*
- *xlrd	2.0.1	2.0.1 *
